          <b>JavaScript</b> is a dynamic computer <b>programming</b> language.
          It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
          implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and
          make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with
          <b>object-oriented</b> capabilities.

        <div><b>Why to Learn Javascript</b></div>
        <p>
          Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand
          exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it
          comes to mastering a new programming language.
        </p>

              In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make
              websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a
              website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic
              content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells
              the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining
              things like color and font.
            </li>
            <li>
              With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but
              doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by
              adding functionality. It’s is responsible for elements that the user
              can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and
              contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations,
              video players, and interactive maps.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose programming language—meaning
              it runs across the entire software stack. The most popular
              application of it is on the client side (aka frontend), but since
              Node.js came on the scene, many people run JavaScript on the server
              side (aka backend) as well.
            </li>
            <li>
              The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes
              of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set
              on a tech career, being proficient in this language will enable you
              to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in
              today’s job market!
            </li>
            <li>
              When used on the client side, JavaScript code is read, interpreted,
              and executed in the user’s web browser. When used on the server
              side, it is run on a remote computer. You can learn more about the
              difference between frontend and backend programming in our guide.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript isn’t only used to create websites. It can also be used
              to build browser-based games and, with the help of certain
              frameworks, mobile apps for different operating systems. The
              creation of new libraries and frameworks is also making it possible
              to build backend programs with the language, such as web apps and
              server apps.
            </li>
            <li>JavaScript is an open-source and most popular client-side scripting language supported by all browsers. JavaScript is mainly used for enhancing the interaction of the webpage with users by making it more lively and interactive. </li>
